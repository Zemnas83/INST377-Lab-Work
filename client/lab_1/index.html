      <div>These images represent my favorite hobbies and items. The first is my favorite show, an anime called One Piece. 
        The second is my favorite NFL team, the Baltimore Ravens. The third depicts some weights because I enjoy weightlifting.
      Finally, I am part of an acappella group because signing is one of my passions.</div>
